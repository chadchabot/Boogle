##We really like to play boggle, so here's a way to brush up on some Python basics, since I've been away from command line stuff for some time.

###todo:
  * use (learn) curses to have better ability to update the console as the user types (ex: as letters are selected)
  * figure out adjacency rules for letters. May be a little more complicated now that there are distinct rows, rather than a 4x4 matrix represented as a flat array. Shouldn't be significantly more difficult.
  * since I don't want to embed a list of valid words in the program, just use the system dictionary, if present, otherwise... ?
